# airbnb-perfect-rating-prediction
This project was completed as part of BUDT758T â€“ Data Mining and centered on building a predictive model to determine whether an Airbnb listing achieves a perfect score. Our goal was to turn raw data into actionable insights for hosts, property managers, and Airbnb by quantifying how features and sentiments in guest reviews impact overall ratings.
